# Machine Learning with data from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation

This repository is organized into <strong>data folders</strong>. Each such folder contains code to setup MMRF datasets from various versions of the raw MMRF files. The datasets from each data folder may be used in multiple different projects. 

Follow the instructions in the data folder to setup the data. You are free to use the data as is. To run machine learning models on the data, you will also need to setup the github repositories for the code. 

## Instructions 
* Enter the desired data folder
* Run the code in `requirements.sh` to setup the relevant packages you will need in order to setup the data
* Follow the instructions to download the relevant MMRF dataset files
* Run the notebooks to setup the data from the raw MMRF dataset files 
* Copy over the 


### Version 1: `ml_mmrf_v1`
* The following research papers use this data:
  * `Inductive Biases for Unsupervised, Sequential models of Cancer Progression`
* MMRF Data Version: IA13
* Goal: Unsupervised learning of high-dimensional patient data
