# ml_mmrf
Machine Learning with data from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation. Each version of the data may have been used
in multiple research projects. 

This repository is organized into <strong>data folders</strong>. Each such folder contains code to setup datasets from various versions of the raw MMRF files. The datasets from each data folder may be used in multiple different projects. 

Follow the instructions in the data folder to setup the data. You are free to use the data as is. To run machine learning models on the data, you will also need to setup the github repositories corresponding to the references and copy the data folder to the . 


### Version 1: `ml_mmrf_v1`
* The following research papers use this data:
  * `Inductive Biases for Unsupervised, Sequential models of Cancer Progression`
* MMRF Data Version: IA13
* Goal: Unsupervised learning of high-dimensional patient data
